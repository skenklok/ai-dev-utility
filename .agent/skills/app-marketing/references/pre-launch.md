## Brand & Messaging

### Brand Positioning Framework

**Positioning Statement Template:**
```
For [target audience]
Who [need/problem]
[App name] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [alternatives]
We [unique differentiator]
```

**Example:**
> For busy professionals who struggle to maintain healthy eating habits, MealPrep Pro is a meal planning app that creates personalized weekly plans in under 5 minutes. Unlike generic recipe apps, we use AI to match your dietary preferences, schedule, and cooking skills.

### Messaging Hierarchy

| Level | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Tagline | One-liner hook | "Meal planning in minutes" |
| Value Proposition | Why you exist | "Healthy eating made effortless" |
| Key Benefits | Top 3 benefits | Simple, personalized, time-saving |
| Features | What you do | AI meal plans, grocery lists, etc. |
| Proof Points | Why believe | "Used by 100K+ busy professionals" |

### Voice & Tone Guidelines

Define your brand voice across dimensions:
- **Formal ↔ Casual**
- **Serious ↔ Playful**  
- **Corporate ↔ Personal**
- **Expert ↔ Friendly**

**Tone by Context:**
| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Marketing | Enthusiastic, inspiring | "Transform your morning routine!" |
| Support | Empathetic, helpful | "We understand that's frustrating..." |
| Error messages | Friendly, apologetic | "Oops! Something went wrong..." |
| Onboarding | Encouraging, simple | "You're doing great! Just one more step." |
